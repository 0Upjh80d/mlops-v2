# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to this repository!

As we are still in the early stages of development, we strongly suggest coordinating with the development team before starting to write code or submit a pull request. Contributions through issues and discussions are always welcome.

## Pull Requests

Once you've coordinated via an issue or discussion, please submit a pull request with your code changes. Our team will review, test, and merge contributions.

We especially encourage contributions focused on automating the development of the v2 solution accelerator. Until we establish this automation, our review and merge process will primarily be manual.
